2)Run the compiled executable.(bash)
./calculator

3)Follow the on-screen prompts to input two numbers and choose an operation.

4)The result of the operation will be displayed.

Examples
*Addition

Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
Choose the operation (+, -, *, /): +
Result: 5 + 3 = 8

*Subtraction

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 4
Choose the operation (+, -, *, /): -
Result: 10 - 4 = 6
